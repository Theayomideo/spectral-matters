# Electron Spectroscopy Analysis Tool
An analytical tool for visualizing the photoionization spectra from an electron spectroscopy experiment

## Overview
In electron spectroscopy, matter is examined by radiating it with a bright light and measuring the kinetic energy of electrons that come off it. This tool aids in analysing the photoionization spectrum, which is demonstrated using simulated data based on argon spectra.

## Installation
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install required libraries: numpy and matplotlib.
- Clone this repository and navigate to the `src` directory to run the main program.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Theayomideo/spectral-matters`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
   pip install numpy matplotlib
4. If using a full stack installer, ensure you're using the correct versions of the libraries.
5. Navigate to the `src` directory to run the main program.

## Libraries
This project uses numpy and matplotlib, and a third-party library, guilib (a custom GUI library built on top of TkInter).
