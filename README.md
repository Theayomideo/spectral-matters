# Electron Spectroscopy Analysis Tool
An analytical tool for visualizing the photoionization spectra from an electron spectroscopy experiment

## Overview
In electron spectroscopy, matter is examined by radiating it with a bright light and measuring the kinetic energy of electrons that come off it. This tool aids in analysing the photoionization spectrum, which is demonstrated using simulated data based on argon. Learn more about the [concept and requirements](./docs/usage.md).

## Installation
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install required libraries: numpy and matplotlib.
- Clone this repository and navigate to the `src` directory to run the main program.

Details on setting up can be found in [installation guide](./docs/installation.md).

## Usage
Refer to the detailed [usage guide](./docs/usage.md) for information on how to use the tool.

## Libraries
This project uses third-party libraries, numpy and matplotlib, and a custom GUI library. Read more about the [libraries and their setup](./docs/libraries.md).
